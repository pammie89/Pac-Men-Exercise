## Description of the Project 
In this exercise, we learned how to create an on-click event to not only start the Pac-Man game but an on-click event that also adds a Pac-Man to the screen with every click. This is done with Javascript using Math.random and such, so that each Pac-Man that is added to the screen has its speed and velocity enabling each Pac-Man to travel across the page at different speeds and directions. I chose to do a bit of customization to the exercise by adding audio and graphics that bring life to the assignment. Just for a bit of fun!

## How to Run
Once you copy all the files, you just open the index.html.  You can add the Pac-Men to the screen first or if you would like to have the sound effects then click start game and then add Pac-Men by clicking on the Pac-Men button

## Roadmap of future improvements
- I would like to improve the board artwork  
- I would like to figure out how to fix where if you click start game multiple times it makes the Pac-Men increase in speed.
